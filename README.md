# KanyeOnceSaid
Welcome to Kanye Once Said! Here we have a wonderful list of several things Kanye has tweeted and with absolutely no context, because even WITH context, it still doesn't make any sense!

Here we have a beautiful button that produces some of Kanye's best, when you click that, you are introduced to a little heart button, liking the quote that has been displayed and it gets added to a list below, you can even remove them! Off to the side there are tabs that DO work, so try those out! And last but not least, we have a few hidden easter eggs that you will have to find by exploring around the page!

This is our phase 1 project for the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp. It was made by Charles, Katie, and some help from Jessica. 

As of right now, the website is kind of basic as far as websites go, so adjustments may be made at a later date. Please feel free to use this website as much as you like!
